### Profile
Yuhei Kagaya (@violetyk)

BSc in Electronic and Information Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Ibaraki College. Yuhei wrote his first program in Logo, a programming language he first saw in middle school in FM-TOWNS. Logo creates "turtle graphic" screen. He still remembers the feeling of seeing the colored firework-like patterns against the dark background. When Yuhei graduated, he became a server-side engineer and worked in system construction and application. Yuhei has also worked in civil service, e-commerce, and auction, e-book, and Internet sectors. Yuhei's dream is to improve people's lifestyles through the Internet. Outside work, his interests are Japanese wine, public baths, soccer, rice candy senbei, and Vim (text editor). He lives with his Shiba Inu.
